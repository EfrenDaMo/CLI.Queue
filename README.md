# CLI.Queue

This a tiny passion project to learn more about how CLI tools work,
if the visuals are obvious this is meant to represent the function of a queue in real life.

What's the queue for nobody really knows, your character just decided to line up because they thought it looked cool.

## Good to know

This project has no official realeses, so you will have to compile your's from scratch.
A makefile has been provided in place of a binary, that allows you to compile the program more easily.

As to why there is no compiled binary reales, it's mostly as a way for people to know what is being compiled in there system.
In less words, it's easier to maintain on my side ig.

Feel free to fork this and modify it to you content, just give credit where credit is do.

### Requirements

You will need will need the clang compiler and Make.

I personally use Arch so the following commands will be related to Arch, make sure to find the correct ones for your OS.

Make: 

```
$ sudo pacman -S make
```

Clang:
```
$ sudo pacman -S clang
```

## Credits

Credits go out to:

* [Portfolio Courses](https://github.com/portfoliocourses): I used their timer code as a base for the timer in the program, you can find their
original code [here](https://github.com/portfoliocourses/c-example-code/blob/main/countdown_timer.c).

* To this random chic who keeps listening to me ramble on and on about these weird ideas I come up with.

* Pending.
